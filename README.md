# Essential .NET Logging

Guidance, links, and additional log destinations for .NET Microsoft.Extensions.Logging

## Getting started

The simplest possible example, using the ubiquitous "Hello World".

Create a new project:

```powershell
dotnet new console --output GettingStarted
```

Add a reference to the Microsoft console logging package:

```powershell
dotnet add GettingStarted package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console 
```

Change the ```using``` at the top of Program.cs, and replace Main function with the following:

**Program.cs**
```c#
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace GettingStarted
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            ILogger<Program> logger = LoggerFactory
                .Create(logging => logging.AddConsole())
                .CreateLogger<Program>();
            logger.LogInformation("Hello World!");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

Run the console application:

```powershell
dotnet run --project GettingStarted
```

A simple "Hello World" isnâ€™t however very useful for showing the different capabilities of logging, so the next page will walk you through a [logging primer](docs/Logging-Primer.md) to introduce the range of features available in [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging).

## Using the loggers

Use Nuget:

## Development getting started

### Pre-requisites

* .NET Core 3.0 development tools
### Compile and test

To test:

```
dotnet test ...
```

### Optional requirements

* PowerShell Core, to run build scripts
* An editor, e.g. VS Code, if you want to contribute

### Build with version number

To build a release version and nuget package, with a gitversion based version number:

```
./build.ps1
```
